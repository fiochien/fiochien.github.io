  				<p>Our recommendation  is for caregivers to carry on with
					their care and feeding routines so long as the caregiver
					is not infected with or experiencing symptoms of the
					virus (or exposed to anyone who is) or under mandatory
					quarantine for having been exposed to a person with the
					virus, and provided that the caregiver following social
					distancing guidelines. This is a rapidly evolving situation.
					We will keep you updated if and when we  become aware

						That Impact Cats</b></h4>
  				<p>If you are involved with community cats, Trap-Neuter-
					Return, colony care, or advocating on behalf of cats, 
					knowing your local laws about cats as well as your state
					anti-cruelty laws is valuable. There may be local laws that
					directly, or indirectly effect Trap-Neuter-Return programs
					and other work you are doing. Additionally, anti-cruelty
					laws exist in all 50 states and apply to all cats.
